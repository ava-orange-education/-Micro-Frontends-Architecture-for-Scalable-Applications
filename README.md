## Micro Frontends Architecture for Scalable Applications

This is the repository for [Micro Frontends Architecture for Scalable Applications](https://orangeava.com/products/micro-frontends-architecture-for-scalable-applications), published by Orange AVA™

## About the Book
As modern web applications grow in complexity, micro frontend architecture offers a scalable, modular approach that helps teams work independently, accelerate delivery, and maintain long-term flexibility. Micro Frontends Architecture for Scalable Applications provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide to implementing micro frontends effectively in real-world projects.

The book starts by defining frontend and backend development, exploring what is considered a valuable architecture, and introducing various frontend architecture patterns.

Next, it dives into micro frontends and concepts like Domain-Driven Design, Decentralized Governance, and Independent Deployments. It explains how these principles enable highly observable (easy-to-monitor) micro frontends and covers in-depth discussions on integration strategies, their advantages and disadvantages.

Communication and routing are thoroughly explored, including Container Applications, State Management, and Cross-Application Communication. The book also addresses UI/UX considerations and how micro frontends interact with varying backend patterns.

The final part focuses on best practices for testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), deployment strategies, and essential security measures. It concludes with a real-world case study and insights into the future of micro frontends—highlighting emerging trends, evolving architectures, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence.
